    ## About Me

    I am a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Walmart** with experience in building **production-grade ML models and scalable software applications**. My primary interests are **Search** (ranking & relevance, retrieval, intent understanding) and **Recommendations**.

    At Walmart Search, I have designed and launched several end-to-end initiatives responsible for significant GMV lifts and relevance gains, delivering accurate search results to millions of shoppers at the world’s largest retailer. My recent work involves bridging gaps in attribute understanding, integrating novel signals into models, and building end-to-end ML frameworks.

    Previously, I worked as a **Software Engineer at Barclays**, where I developed scalable microservices and real-time payment solutions for major clients including Amazon.

    I hold a **Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) from UC Berkeley**, specializing in Data Science.

    I also spent time at the **Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab**, working on **few-shot learning in NLP using semi-supervised techniques** under [Prof. Michael Mahoney](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QXyvv94AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Francisco Utrera](https://www.franciscoutrera.com/). I have received **Excellence Awards** at Walmart and Barclays, and the **Fung Excellence Scholarship** at UC Berkeley.

    I am an alumni mentor for the Artificial Intelligence, Data Science & Analytics affinity groups at UC Berkeley. I also stay updated on the latest advances in **Search and Recommendations** by actively participating in top IR conferences such as *SIGIR, ICDM, CIKM, and RecSys*. For more details, see the [Workshops section](#workshops-organized).
