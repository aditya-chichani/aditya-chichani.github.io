## Overview

The advent of multimodal LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini has significantly boosted the potential for multimodal search and recommendations. Traditional search engines rely mainly on textual queries, supplemented by session and geographical data. In contrast, multimodal systems create a shared embedding space for text, images, audio, and more, enabling next-gen customer experiences. These advancements lead to more accurate and personalized recommendations, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

MMSR will be a **full-day** workshop at [CIKM 2024](https://cikm2024.org/) exploring the latest advancements, challenges, and applications of multimodal search and recommendations.

## Workshop Program Format

The workshop will include keynote speeches, research paper presentations, interactive networking sessions, and a panel discussion on **_Emerging trends and challenges in multimodal search and recommendations_**. The workshop will primarily be in person.

- 2 invited talks (1 from academia, 1 from industry)
- Long (15 min) contributed talks
- Lightning (5 min) contributed talks with discussion session
- Panel discussion
