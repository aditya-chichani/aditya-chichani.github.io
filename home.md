title: CIKM MMSR â€˜24 
subtitle: 1st Workshop on Multimodal Search and Recommendations
---

## Overview

With the advent of multimodal LLMs like GPT and Gemini and release of open-source multimodal
models, the potential for multimodal search and recommendations has significantly increased.
While traditional search engines often augment user queries with session and geographical data,
they primarily rely on textual queries. In contrast, multimodal systems offer next-gen customer
experience by creating a shared embedding space for text, images, audio, etc. These advancements
enable more accurate, personalized recommendations, enhancing user satisfaction and
engagement. This workshop explores the latest advancements, challenges, and applications of
multimodal search and recommendations through keynotes, presentations and a panel discussion.

## Call for Papers

This workshop aims to unite the research community to address multimodal challenges specifically
in the search and recommendation domain of Information Retrieval (IR). Since CIKM has a large
community of researchers and practitioners in multimodal data and IR, it would be mutually
beneficial to host this workshop here. Given the wide-ranging applications of search across
industries and recent advancements in multimodal large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o
and Gemini, which can democratize multimodal IR, it is crucial to have a dedicated platform to
discuss the latest research and challenges in this field.
