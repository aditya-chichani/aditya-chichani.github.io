This workshop aims to unite the research community to address multimodal challenges specifically
in the search and recommendation domain of Information Retrieval (IR). Given the recent advancements in multimodal large language models (LLMs) that can democratize multimodal IR, we will use MMSR '24 as a dedicated platform to discuss the latest research and challenges in this field.

### Theme : Transforming Search and Recommendations with Multimodal Approaches

#### Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

1. **Cross-modal retrieval techniques**
 1. Strategies for efficiently indexing and retrieving multimodal data.
 2. Approaches to ensure cross-modal retrieval systems can handle large-scale data.
 3. Development of metrics to measure similarity across different data modalities.
2. **Applications of Multimodal Search and Recommendations to Verticals** (e.g. E-commerce,
real estate)
 1. Implementing and optimizing image-based product searches.
 2. Creating multimodal conversational systems to enhance user experience and make search more accessible.
 3. Utilizing AR to enhance product discovery and user interaction.
